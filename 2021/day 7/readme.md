# Day 7 - Distribution - Physical. 

Just used the Chickweight dataset for day 7.

Showing the distribution weight in a boxplot. 

Not completely happy with this. I know day 8 is for animals but going to do more animals on day 8. 
Different data and better outcome. I need to get better at distribution charts.
