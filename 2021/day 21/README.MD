# Day 21 - Time Series - Downwards

For this downward time series I looked at [survivoR] package that has all of the Suvivor reality TV show information. I compared the ratings of the first season and the latest (2020) to see the downward drop. 

Ratings did not seem to drop much in season 40 at least but it was still a heafy drop from the first season. Now if we just look at season 1. It has a drop between the 5th and 6th episode in the first season.
