# Day 20 Timeseries - Upwards

Data used: https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave/dogecoin-historical-data

Which the data seems to be updated daily. 

As DOGE has been on an upward journey I plotted candlestick chart showing the journey it has made so far in this month alone. I did look at all time due to the close price was so tiny compared to recent the chart would not have been visually appealling. 

Fun plot and learning the tidyquant library to do candlestick plots.
