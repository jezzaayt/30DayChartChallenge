# Day 22 Timeseries Animation

Honestly, not completely happy with the animation but its so difficult to get right on timing and the length of making each animation to check different settings.

Though it shows that most meteorites are under 5000 KG. The Data was originally in grams but converted it to KG else the data was giving scientific notation
