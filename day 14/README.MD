# 30 Day Chart Challenge
## Day 14 
#### Space

Today I used the UFO Dataset from TidyTuesday [2019 06 25](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-25)


Showing the relationship over time with the amount of UFO sightings/reports. By this, it's possible to see by the 1990s there began to see increased number of reports especially in the US. Whereas there were still similar number of sightings outside of the US

Then using the ggforce library I used a facet_zoom to zoom into the famous year of the Roswell crash. Showing there were 2 other reports of UFOs in this year
