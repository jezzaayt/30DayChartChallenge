# Day 8 - Animals - Distribution

Palmer Penguins, only really animal dataset I found available. Found it via the tidytuesday github. 

I used ggridges package to create a ridge density distribution of the penguin species  across different islands showing their body weight distribution with fill of their sex

Simple but showing the distribution. Believe I could have made bit better but getting more and more plots done daily trying to improve. I could have made it interactivity on the fill perhaps can do that for future plots like this using plotly.
