# Day 9 Distribution - Statistics Coffee Ratings

I went for coffee ratings for statistics of distributions because people rate coffee and it forms part of the statistics. 

For day 9 I used the Coffee Ratings dataset from Tidytuesday 2020

Visualised with a violin plot on coffee ratings by variety and by country on their cup points. I went with a violin plot for this distribution 
I tried out different themes from the hrbrtheme package. I wanted to get country flags on the labels alas was unable to do so.
