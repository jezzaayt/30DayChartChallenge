# Day 19 -  Global Change - Time Series 

Data from: https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks

I looked at shark attacked over the years then the last 10 years that was in the dataset to see who were attacked between males and females within the countries and time period

I was surprised to see more attacks happen in USA over Australia where they seem to be more on the news from attacks that I personally hear about. However, data may not be 100% accurate just running with what is in the dataset.
